Heart Disease Prediction Project
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various medical attributes. It utilizes a machine learning model trained on a dataset of patient information and provides a simple web interface for real-time predictions.

Project Overview
The core of this project is an ensemble machine learning model that combines the strengths of a Random Forest Classifier and an XGBoost Classifier to achieve higher accuracy in predicting heart disease. The project also includes scripts for data exploration, model training, and a web application built with Streamlit to make the prediction model accessible to users.
Features
•	Data Visualization: Generates histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps to understand the dataset.
•	Feature Engineering: Creates new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
•	Hyperparameter Tuning: Uses GridSearchCV to find the optimal parameters for the machine learning models.
•	Ensemble Modeling: Employs a VotingClassifier to combine predictions from multiple models for better accuracy and robustness.
•	Class Imbalance Handling: Uses SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address class imbalance in the dataset.
•	Interactive Web App: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit that allows users to input their medical data and get an instant heart disease prediction.
Workflow
1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The visualizations.py script is used to explore the dataset, understand feature distributions, and identify correlations between different variables.
2.	Data Preprocessing: The main.py script loads the data, handles categorical variables by one-hot encoding, and creates interaction features.
3.	Model Training: The script trains a Random Forest Classifier and an XGBoost Classifier on the preprocessed data. GridSearchCV is used to tune their hyperparameters.
4.	Ensemble Learning: The best-performing versions of the two models are combined into a soft-voting VotingClassifier ensemble.
5.	Model Serialization: The trained ensemble model is saved to a file (ensemble_model.pkl) using pickle for later use in the web application.
6.	Prediction Web App: The app.py script loads the saved model and provides a web interface where users can input values for age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc., to receive a prediction.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is heart.csv. It contains the following columns:
•	age: Age of the patient.
•	cholesterol: Cholesterol level.
•	bp: Blood pressure.
•	sex: Gender of the patient (Male/Female).
•	diabetes: Whether the patient has diabetes (Yes/No).
•	heart_disease: The target variable, indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.
File Descriptions
•	main.py: The main script for data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and saving the final ensemble model.
•	visualizations.py: A script dedicated to generating plots for exploratory data analysis of the heart.csv dataset.
•	app.py: A Streamlit web application that loads the trained model and provides an interface for users to get predictions.
•	heart.csv: The dataset containing patient data used for training and testing the model.
•	ensemble_model.pkl: (Generated by main.py) The serialized, trained machine learning model.

Setup and Usage
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-directory>


2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate


3. Install the required dependencies:
It's recommended to create a requirements.txt file with the following content:
pandas
scikit-learn
xgboost
imbalanced-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
streamlit


Then, install them using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Train the model:
Run the main.py script to preprocess the data and train the model. This will create the ensemble_model.pkl file.
python main.py


5. Run the Streamlit Web App:
Once the model is trained and saved, you can launch the web application.
streamlit run app.py


Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501) to use the prediction app.
